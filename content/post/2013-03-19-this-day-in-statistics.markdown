![](http://t1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTz0RJ5BOzk0cIVs6aCOVICnYLfBlEK-MnZkSvAHbfDxd0Csh4Pkg)I was looking to find an add-on Google Calendar that included important days in the history of statistics. They have one for seemingly everything under the sun, except this. So I created one and made it public in honor of the International Year of Statistics. I will continually add to it as I find time.

Feel free to add it. As always, it is available in the following formats



	
  * [HTML](http://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=umn.edu_k25l10mrcjvhsl1mpggbnfjmuc%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America/Chicago )

	
  * [XML](http://www.google.com/calendar/feeds/umn.edu_k25l10mrcjvhsl1mpggbnfjmuc%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic)

	
  * [iCal](http://www.google.com/calendar/ical/umn.edu_k25l10mrcjvhsl1mpggbnfjmuc%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics)


Want me to add an important birthday? Add the info into the comments section. Want to be an author on the calendar so you can add all 100 statistician's that you know I forgot? Send me an email and I will add you on.
