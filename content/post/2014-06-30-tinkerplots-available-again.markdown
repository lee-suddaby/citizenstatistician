Very exciting news for [Tinkerplots](https://www.srri.umass.edu/tinkerplots) users (and for those who should be Tinkerplots users).  Tinkerplots is highly visual dynamic software that lets students design and implement simulation machines, and includes many very cool data analysis tools.

To quote from TP developer Cliff Konold:


<blockquote>Today we are releasing Version 2.2 of TinkerPlots.  This is a special, free version, which will expire in a year  — August 31, 2015.

**To start the downloading process**

Go to the[ TinkerPlots home page](http://www.srri.umass.edu/tinkerplots) and click on the **Download TinkerPlots **link in the right hand panel. You'll fill out a form. Shortly after submitting it, you'll get an email with a link for downloading.

**Help others find the TinkerPlots Download page**

If you have a website, blog, or use a social media site, please help us get the word out so others can find the new TinkerPlots Download page. You could mention that you are using TinkerPlots 2.2 and link to [www.srri.umass.edu/tinkerplots](http://www.srri.umass.edu/tinkerplots).

**Why is this an expiring version?**

As we explained in [this correspondence](https://www.srri.umass.edu/node/622), until January of 2014, TinkerPlots was published and sold by Key Curriculum, a division of McGraw Hill Education. Their decision to cease publication caught us off guard, and we have yet to come up with an alternative publishing plan. We created this special expiring version to meet the needs of users until we can get a new publishing plan in place.

**What will happen after version 2.2 expires?**

By August 2015, we will either have a new publisher lined up, or we will create another free version.  What is holding us up right now is our negotiations with the University of Massachusetts Amherst, who currently owns TinkerPlots.  Once they have decided about their future involvement with TinkerPlots, we can complete our discussions with various publishing partners.

**If I have versions 2.0 or 2.1 should I delete them?**

No, you should keep them. You already paid for these, and they are not substantively different from version 2.2. If and when a new version of TinkerPlots is ready for sale, you may not want to pay for it.  So keep your early version that you've already paid for.
