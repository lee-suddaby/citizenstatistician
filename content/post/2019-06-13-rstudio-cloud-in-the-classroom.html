<p>Much has been written in statistics and data science education literature about pedagogical tools and approaches to provide a practical computational foundation for students. However a common friction point for getting students (and faculty) started with computing is installation and setup. If youâ€™ve heard me talk about teaching R, youâ€™ve probably heard me mention the following day one dilemma:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Option 1 ðŸ˜°</th>
<th>Option 2 ðŸ˜Ž</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>1. Install R</td>
<td>1. Go to RStudio in your browser</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>2. Install RStudio</td>
<td>2. Log in</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>3. Install the following packages: tidyverse, rmarkdown, etc.</td>
<td>3. <code>hello R!</code></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>4. Load these packages</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>5. Install git</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Last week I gave a webinar on using RStudio Cloud as a lightweight infrastructure solution for Step 1 of Option 2 above. Circumventing the installation step early in the course by having students access R and RStudio in the cloud can minimize frustration and improve buy in, and RStudio Cloud is one (super convenient!) way of enabling your students to access RStudio in their browser â€“ and you donâ€™t need to know how to set up a server or the help of an IT professional!</p>
<p>In the webinar I went through the logistics of setting up a course in RStudio Cloud, shared practices that worked well for me in mid-to-large sized courses, and walked through some screen captures of the experience of navigating RStudio Cloud from the perspective of the instructor and the student.</p>
