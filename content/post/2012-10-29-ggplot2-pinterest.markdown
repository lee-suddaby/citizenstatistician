I don't understand the website Pinterest, but it looks pretty (especially on the iPad), and an undergraduate student said it was the greatest thing since Facebook, so I thought I would give it a shot. The idea is that Pinterest "lets you organize and share all the beautiful things you find on the web." You organize beautiful things by creating a "board" (a page), and then adding "pins" (links to websites).

My thought was...plots in ggplot2 are beautiful...I will create a board with useful links/tutorials for creating ggplot2 plots!

I already have three followers. Now you can follow too.
