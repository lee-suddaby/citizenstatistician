Rob will be be participating in this event, organized by Nicholas Horton:

CONNECTION WITH COMMUNITY COLLEGES: second in the guidelines for undergraduate statistics programs webinar series

The American Statistical Association endorses the value of undergraduate programs in statistical science, both for statistical science majors and for students in other majors seeking a minor or concentration. Guidelines for such programs were promulgated in 2000, and a new workgroup is working to update them.

To help gather input and identify issues and areas for discussion, the workgroup has organized a series of webinars to focus on different issues.

**Connection with Community Colleges**
Monday, October 21st, 6:00-6:45pm Eastern Time

Description: Community colleges serve a key role in the US higher education system, accounting for approximately 40% of all enrollments. In this webinar, representatives from community colleges and universities with many community college transfers will discuss the interface between the systems and ways to prepare students for undergraduate degrees and minors in statistics.

The webinar is free to attend, and a recording will be made available after the event.Â  To sign up, please email Rebecca Nichols ([rebecca@amstat.org](mailto:rebecca@amstat.org)).
