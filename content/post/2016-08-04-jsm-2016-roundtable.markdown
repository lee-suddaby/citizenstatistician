Monday morning at JSM 2016 [Andrew Bray](https://andrewpbray.github.io/) and I hosted a roundtable on integrating open access and open source statistics education materials. It was a fruitful discussion with participants from 2-year colleges, 4-year colleges, and industry.

In preparation for the roundtable we put together a one-page handout listing a sampling of open access and open source statistics resources, with links to the resources. The handout is below for anyone who is interested (click on the image to get to the PDF with hyperlinks), and if you think of other resources that would be useful to list here, please comment below and I'll periodically update list.
