I'm a bit late in posting this, but travel delays post-JSM left me weary, so I'm just getting around to it. Better late than never?

![](http://citizen-statistician.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Vassily_Kandinsky_1923_-_On_White_II-150x150.jpg)Wednesday at JSM featured an invited statistics education session on Modernizing the Undergraduate Statistics Curriculum. This session featured two types of speakers: those who are currently involved in undergraduate education and those who are on the receiving end of graduating majors. The speakers involved in undergraduate education presented on their recent efforts for modernizing the undergraduate statistics curriculum to provide the essential computational and problem solving skills expected from today’s modern statistician while also providing a firm grounding in theory and methods. The speakers representing industry discussed their expectations (or hopes and dreams) for new graduates and where they find gaps in the knowledge of new hires.

The speakers were  Nick Horton (Amherst College), Hilary Parker (Stitch Fix), Jo Hardin (Pomona College), and Colin Rundel (Duke University). The discussant was Rob Gould (UCLA). Here are the slides for each of the speakers. If you have any comments or questions, let us know in the comments.
