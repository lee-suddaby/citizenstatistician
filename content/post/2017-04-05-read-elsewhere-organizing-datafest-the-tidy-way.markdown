Part of the reason why we have been somewhat silent at Citizen Statistician is that it's DataFest season, and that means a few weeks (months?) of all consuming organization followed by a weekend of super fun data immersion and exhaustion... Each year that I organize DataFest I tell myself _"next year, I'll do [blah] to make my life easier"_. This year I finally did it! Read about how I've been streamlining the process of registrations, registration confirmations, and dissemination of information prior to the event on my post titled [_"Organizing DataFest the tidy way"_](https://rviews.rstudio.com/2017/04/05/datafestorg/) on the [R Views blog](https://rviews.rstudio.com/).

Stay tuned for an update on ASA DataFest 2017 once [all 31 DataFests around the globe](http://ww2.amstat.org/education/datafest/participants.cfm) have concluded!
