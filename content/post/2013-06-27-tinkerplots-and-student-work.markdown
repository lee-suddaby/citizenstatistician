Technology Innovations in Statistics Education has published a paper by Noleine Fitzallen that I think many readers of this blog will find interesting.  She examines a group of young students to see the ways that they use Tinkerplots to analyze data.  Here's the abstract and link:

[**Characterising Students' Interaction with TinkerPlots**](http://escholarship.org/uc/item/1074n1dp)

Exploration of the way in which students interacted with the software package, _TinkerPlots Dynamic Data Exploration_, to answer questions about a data set using different forms of graphical representations, revealed that the students used three dominant strategies – _Snatch and Grab, Proceed and Falter_, and _Explore and Complete_. The participants in the study were 12 year 5-and-6 students (11-12 years old) who completed data analysis activities and answered questions about the data analysis process undertaken. The data for the inquiry were collected by on-screen capture video as the students worked at the computer with _TinkerPlots_. Thematic analysis was used to explore the data to determine the students’ strategies when conducting data analysis within the software environment.
