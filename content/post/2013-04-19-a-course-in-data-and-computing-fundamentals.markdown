Daniel Kaplan and Libby Shoop have developed a one-credit class called _Data Computation Fundamentals_, which was offered this semester at Macalester College. This course is part of a larger research and teaching effort funded by Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) to help students understand the fundamentals and structures of data, especially big data.  [Read more about the project in [Macalester Magazine](http://www.macalester.edu/news/2013/01/why-big-data-is-a-big-deal).]

The course introduces students to R and covers topics such as merging data sources, data formatting and cleaning, clustering and text mining. Within the course, the more specific goals are:



	
  * Introducing students to the basic ideas of data presentation

	
    * Graphics modalities

	
    * Transforming and combining data

	
    * Summarizing patterns with models

	
    * Classification and dimension reduction




	
  * Developing the skills students need to make effective data presentations

	
    * Access to tabular data

	
    * Re-organization of tabular data for combining different sources

	
    * Proficiency with basic techniques for modeling, classification, and dimension reduction.

	
    * Experience with choices in data presentation




	
  * Developing the confidence students need to work with modern tools

	
    * Computer commands

	
    * Documentation and work-flow





Kaplan and Shoop have put their [entire course online](http://rpubs.com/dtkaplan/DCF-Spring2013-Syllabus) using RPubs (the web publishing system hosted by [RStudio](http://rstudio.com)).
