I received the following from Cliff Konold:


<blockquote>We have just release the following to answer questions many have asked us about when TinkerPlots will be available for sale again. Unfortunately, we do not have a list of current users to send this to, so please distribute this to others you think would be interested.</blockquote>

March 21, 2014

As you may have discovered by now, you can no longer purchase _TinkerPlots_. Many of you who have been using _TinkerPlots_ in courses and workshops have found your way to us asking if and when it will be available for purchase again. We expect soon, by this June.  But to allow you to make informed decisions about future instructional uses of _TinkerPlots_, we need to provide a little background.

On December 10, 2013, we received a letter from McGraw-Hill Education giving us notice that in 90 days they would be terminating their agreement with us to publish _TinkerPlots_. For those of you who remember Key Curriculum as our publisher, McGraw-Hill Education acquired Key in August 2012, and as part of that acquisition became the new publisher of _The Geometer's Sketchpad_, _Fathom_, and _TinkerPlots_.

Though McGraw-Hill Education had informally told us of their plans to terminate sales of both _TinkerPlots_ and _Fathom_ as of December 31, 2013, we were nevertheless surprised when they actually did this. We were assuming this wouldn't happen until mid March (i.e., 90 days). In any case, since January 1 of this year, no new licenses for _TinkerPlots_ have been sold.

Fortunately, _TinkerPlots_ is actually owned by our University, so we are now free to find another publisher. We are in ongoing discussions with four different organizations who have expressed interest in publishing _TinkerPlots_. But there are many components of _TinkerPlots_ in addition to the application (data sets, activities, help manual, instructional movies, tutorials, on-line course materials, artwork, the license server/installer, the list of existing users), which McGraw-Hill Education does own that would be hard to do without; to replace them would require a significant undertaking. Fortunately, McGraw-Hill Education has indicated their willingness to transfer most all of these assets to us, and we are very grateful for this because they are not legally bound to do so.  However, we have not yet received any of these resources or written permission that we can use them. Until we do, we cannot realistically build and release another version of the application. We are in regular communication with people at McGraw-Hill Education who have assured us that they will begin very shortly to deliver to us these materials and official permissions for their use.

We have been telling folks that a new version of _TinkerPlots_ will be available by June 2014, and we still think this a reasonable timeframe.  We'd give it about an 85% probability. By August, 98.2%.

In the meantime, if you have unused licenses for _TinkerPlots_, you will still be able to register new computers on that license number. To see how many licenses you have, go to License Information... under the Help menu. If you have one license, our memory is that you can actually register 3 computers on it — they built in a little leeway. From that same dialog box you can also deregister a computer and in this way free up a currently used license. (We just checked, and when the deregister dialog comes up, it now has the name of _Sketchpad_ where _TinkerPlots_ should be.  But ignore that. It's just an indication of the publisher slowly phasing the name _TinkerPlots_ out of its system.)

Also, the resource links under the _TinkerPlots_ Help menu still take you to resources such as movies on the publisher's site. They have told us, however, that after March 2015, they will discontinue hosting these materials on their web site. But by that time, all these should be available on the site of the new publisher.

We are so sorry for the inconvenience this interruption and the lack of communication has caused many of you. McGraw-Hill Education has not notified its existing users, and we don't know who most of you are.  We have heard of several instances where teachers planning to start a course or workshop in a few days have suddenly learned that their students will not be able to purchase _TinkerPlots_, and they have had to quickly redesign their course. We understand that because of this ordeal, some of you will decide to jump ship on _TinkerPlots_. But we certainly hope that most of you will stick with us through this bumpy transition. We have put nearly 15 years of ourselves into the creation of _TinkerPlots_ and the development of its community, and we are committed to keeping both going.
