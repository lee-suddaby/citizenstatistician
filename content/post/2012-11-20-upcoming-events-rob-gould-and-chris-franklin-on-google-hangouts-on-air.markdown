Update: the event has ended, [but can be watched via YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=bfcdbwyqDjg#!)

Google+ Policy by the Numbers is airing a K-12 statistics education discussion on Nov. 28 at 4 pm EST via Hangout on Air. With the ever-increasing number of students taking AP Statistics each year and the inclusion of statistics in the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics, Franklin and Gould will address the value of statistical literacy, the increasing interest, and the challenges. Please tune in Nov. 28 at 4 p.m. EST at the Policy By the Numbers Google+ page.Â  I thank the American Statistical Association for working with Google+ to arrange the event.
