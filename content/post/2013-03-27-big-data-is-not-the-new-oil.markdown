Our colleague and dear friend John Holcomb sent an email to Rob and I in which he asked if we had heard the phrase "Big data is the new oil". Neither of us had, but according to [Jer Thorp](http://blog.blprnt.com/about), ad executives are uttering this phrase upwards of 100 times a day.

Jer's article is worth a read. While he points out in the title that big data is not the new oil, he astutely suggests that the oil/data metaphor does work to an extent. After describing data as a human resource (a thesis of his [TED talk](http://www.ted.com/talks/jer_thorp_make_data_more_human.html)), Jer makes, and expounds on, three points that resonated with me



	
  1. People need to understand and experience data ownership.


	
  2. We need to have a more open conversation about data and ethics.

	
  3. We need to change the way that we collectively think about data, so that it is not a new oil, but instead a new kind of resource entirely.


I am not sure which "we" he is referring to, but I might argue that society at large needs to have this conversation, and more importantly, the data users/statisticians/executives that make decisions to collect the data need to be having these conversations.
