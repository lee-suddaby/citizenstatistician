We live in the Data Deluge, but we confess we still teach stats as if data were rare and easily-managed.  But in this blog, we embrace the Deluge, an age where data and software are accessible and ubiquitous.  The day of telling students to pay attention because Some Day This Will Be Good For You are over.  This stuff is good for them NOW, and we need to show them why.

In the future, we hope to share our thoughts about teaching future data scientists, fun data sets, cool apps, exciting software. That sort of thing.  It's all about data.
