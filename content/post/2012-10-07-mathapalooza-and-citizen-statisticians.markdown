This Friday, I (Rob) had the honor of giving the same talk three times in a row at the Mathapalooza, held at one of the Austin City College campuses. The audience was mostly central-Texas area community college faculty.  Giving the same talk three times in a row can be tiring, but the professors were very engaged and  very involved and so I had fun.  The topic was 'Educating Citizen Statisticians', and I mentioned the need to do what it takes so that intro stats is the most important class students take in college.  Intro Stats should be most important because today's students have access to data and to data analysis tools, and so have access to opportunities as never before.  And it should be most important because data privacy issues are of such importance and have the potential to do real harm to those who aren't aware of these issues.
