It took me all of 30 minutes from starting this mini-project to writing this post. 
This is not meant to be a brag, but instead an ode to reproducibility. Last year 
for JSM 2018 I made a Shiny app to browse the conference schedule. I personally 
found that app really useful, and I know a few others did as well. And I saved 
my code in a [GitHub repo](https://github.com/mine-cetinkaya-rundel/jsm2018-schedule).

Now that JSM 2019 is almost here, I thought I'd try my code again. I was hoping 
everything would just work as is, but I was worried that the structure of the 
HTML file used in the online schedule may have changed, requiring me to update 
my data scraping code. Thankfully, that was not the case! I was able to re-scrape 
the data, create the app, and publish it within a matter of minutes!

You can find the app [here](https://minecr.shinyapps.io/jsm2019-schedule/) and 
the code [here](https://github.com/mine-cetinkaya-rundel/jsm2019-schedule).

I made two changes to the UI of the app: 

- Reflect the name change of the education section to "Section on Statistics and 
Data Science Education".
- Add a footnote linking to the official JSM 2019 online program.

Under the hood I also 
[added a namespace qualifier](https://github.com/mine-cetinkaya-rundel/jsm2019-schedule/blob/b48ba34d8a4750fb61b87c002e71aa6702a62ab4/app.R#L16) 
to the `pluck()` function to indicate I'm using `purrr::pluck()`. I have been 
trying to be more careful about this in projects that use packages with shared 
function names. The [**conflicted** package](https://conflicted.r-lib.org/) 
is great for telling you when this is the case, and also for training you to 
remember to resolve conflicts before a bug in your code requires you to go on 
a conflict hunt.

I also thought about adding my JSM 2019 itinerary to this post, but then I couldn't 
boast about how quickly it came together. Can someone make an app for helping me 
select among the many great sessions **and** add those sessions to my calendar 
which is currently in UK time?
