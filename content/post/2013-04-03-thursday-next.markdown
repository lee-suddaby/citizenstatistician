From Jasper Fforde's latest Thursday Next novel (The Woman Who Died Alot):


<blockquote>The Office for Ultimate Risk is one of the many departments within the Ministry of National Statistics. Although it was originally an “experimental” department, the statisticians at Ultimate Risk proved their worth by predicting the entire results of three football World Cups in succession, a finding that led to the discontinuation of football as a game and the results being calculated instead.</blockquote>
