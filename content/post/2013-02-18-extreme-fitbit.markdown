I have been mourning the loss this week of my FitBit.  No idea where it went.  That's the problem with small, portable data collection devices.  The very feature that makes them useable makes them lose-able.  Then I came across this possible solution

[http://www.engadget.com/2013/01/21/australian-firefighters-test-data-transmitting-pills/](http://www.engadget.com/2013/01/21/australian-firefighters-test-data-transmitting-pills/)

which raises entirely new questions about edible lines of data collection devices.
