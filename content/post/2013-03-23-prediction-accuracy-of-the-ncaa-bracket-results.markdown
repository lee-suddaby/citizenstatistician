In  Emanuel Derman’s book _Models. Behaving. Badly,_ the author lays out a _Modeler’s Hippocratic Oath_.



	
  * I will remember that I didn’t make the world, and it doesn’t satisfy my equations.

	
  * Though I will use models boldly to estimate value, I will not be overly impressed by mathematics.

	
  *  I will never sacrifice reality for elegance without explaining why I have done so.

	
  * Nor will I give the people who use my model false comfort about its accuracy. Instead, I will make explicit its assumptions and oversights.

	
  * I understand that my work may have enormous effects on society and the economy, many of them beyond my comprehension.


Since I have no desire for instilling false comfort with the non-replicable, [fuzzy mascot/alphabetical order model that I used to predict the NCAA tournament](http://citizen-statistician.org/2013/03/21/ncaa-basketball-visualization/), I report my results after two days in.



	
  * Overall the model has correctly predicted 19 of the 32 games correctly. This is not any better than chance (_p _= .108, one-sided).

	
    * Conditionally, the model performed **best in the East Regional** (6/8, _p =_ .035, one-sided). It was worst in the West and South Regionals (4/8 in both, _p-_value not reported due to complete stupidity of the model.). The performance in the Midwest Regional, like so many things Midwest, was so-so (5/8, _p =_ .145, one-sided).




	
  * The model has not, as yet, "busted" my bracket.

	
    * I still have 11 of the Sweet Sixteen teams predicted still alive in my bracket.

	
    * I still have 7 of the Elite Eight teams predicted still alive in my bracket.

	
    * I still have 4 of the Final Four predicted teams still alive in my bracket.




	
  * The president also has 19 out of 32 correct predictions in his bracket. Thirteen of his Sweet Sixteen, 7 of his Elite Eight, and 4 of his final four  predictions are still alive.

	
  * According to my prediction about the Minnesota/UCLA game being a good matchup...it pretty much was. Both teams played terribly. It was so close that neither team scored a field goal in the first five minutes of the game.


To recover from no only watching this game, but also from the mundanity of this blog post, I offer you comfort in the visualization of [Nate Silver's bracket of predictions](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/03/18/sports/ncaabasketball/nate-bracket.html?_r=2&).
