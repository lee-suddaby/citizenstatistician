I'm pleased to announce that on Monday, September 11 , 9-11 am Pacific, I'll be leading a Concord Consortium Data Science Education Webinar. Oddly, I forgot to give it a title, but it would be something like "Towards a Learning Trajectory for K-12 Data Science". This webinar, like all Concord webinars, is intended to be highly interactive. Participants should have their favorite statistical software at the ready. A detailed abstract as well as registration information is [here](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/data-science-education-webinar-rob-gould-tickets-35216886656).

At the same site you can view recent wonderful webinars by Cliff Konold, Hollylynne Lee and Tim Erickson.
