The [L.A. Times today](http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/editorials/la-ed-data-privacy-20121119,0,7387282.story) (Monday, November 19) ran an editorial about the benefits and costs of Big Data.  I truly believe that statisticians should teach introductory students (and all students, really) about data privacy. But who feels they have a realistic handle on the nature of these threats and the size of the risk? I know I don't.  Does anyone teach this in their class?  Let's hear about it!  In the meantime, you might enjoy reading (or re-reading) a [classic on the topic by Latanya Sweeney: k-Anonymity: a model for protecting privacy.](http://dataprivacylab.org/people/sweeney/kanonymity.html)
