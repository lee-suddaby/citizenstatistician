[Jeffrey Breen](http://jeffreybreen.wordpress.com/) just gave a talk entitled "[Tapping the Data Deluge with R](http://www.slideshare.net/jeffreybreen/tapping-the-data-deluge-with-r)" to the[ Boston Predictive Analytics Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Predictive-Analytics/events/81297972/). He suggests there are two types of data in this world



	
  1. Data you have, and

	
  2. Data you don't have...yet.


In the talk Jeffrey provided a nice overview of several methods for importing data into R, including:

	
  * Reading CSV files

	
  * Reading XLS files

	
  * Reading data formats from other statistics packages (e.g., SPSS, Stata, etc.)

	
  * Reading email data

	
  * Reading online data files

	
  * Web scraping data

	
  * Using APIs to access data


He also touches on some of the R packages that are useful for adding supplementary data to enrich an analysis (e.g., zipcode).
