Check out my guest post on the [Simulation-based statistical inference](https://www.causeweb.org/sbi/) blog:

[Teaching computation as an argument for simulation-based inference](https://www.causeweb.org/sbi/?p=971)

If you are interested in teaching simulation-based methods, or if you just want to find out more why others are, I highly recommend the posts on this blog. The page also hostsÂ many other useful resources as well as information on upcoming workshops as well.
