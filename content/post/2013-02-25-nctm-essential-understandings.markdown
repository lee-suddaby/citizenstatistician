NCTM has finally published books on statistics in its EU series. This is a rather traditional approach to statistics, given the context of this blog. But, since I'm a co-author (along with Roxy Peck and Stephen Miller), why not point you to it?

And while the book is not computational in theme, it does address a central issue of this blog: universal statistical knowledge.

A grades 6-9 version is due out any moment. Stay tuned.
