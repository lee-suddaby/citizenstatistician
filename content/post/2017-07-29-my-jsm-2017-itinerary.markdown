JSM 2017 is almost here. I just landed in Maryland, and I finally managed to finish combing through the entire program. What a packed schedule! I like writing an itinerary post each year, mainly so I can come back to it during and after the event. I obviously won't make it to all sessions listed for each time slot below, but my decision for which one(s) to attend during any time period will likely depend on proximity to previous session, and potentially also proximity to childcare area.

The focus of the sessions I selected are education, data science, computing, visualization, and social responsibility. In addition to talks on topics I actively work in, I also enjoy listening to talks in application areas I'm interested in, hence the last topic on this list.

If you have suggestions for other sessions (in these topics or other) that you think would be interested, let me know in the comments!
