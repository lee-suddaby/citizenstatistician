Yup. You read it here first.  The National Climatic Data Center has a [nice overview](http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/customer-support/education-resources/groundhog-day) that compares climate data to Punxsutawney Phil's predictions.  The data aren't quite (yet) upload-ready, but some links on the page to more raw data might be entertaining.
