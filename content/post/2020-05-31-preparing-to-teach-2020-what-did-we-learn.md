### Implementing GAISE recommendations - Allan Rossman

New emphases in the [GAISE revision](https://www.amstat.org/asa/education/Guidelines-for-Assessment-and-Instruction-in-Statistics-Education-Reports.aspx) expand the recommendation for "teach statistical thinking" to include:

- "Teach statistics as investigative process of problem-solving and decision-making."
- "Give students experience with multivariable thinking."

Provide students with a dataset and ask them to define a research question that can be answered using a certain statistical test. This has two benefits. You allow students to more organically investigate a dataset and you get to see what is interesting to students and what their domain interests are.

Want some ideas for building examples? Check out Allan's blog, [Ask Good Questions](https://askgoodquestions.blog/posts/).

### Teaching focused career opportunities - Jo Hardin

Even if it isn't necessary at your institution, grant writing is a good time for reflection. You'll be forced to synthesize your research program. 

When considering options across liberal arts colleges, teaching universities, and at research universities it is important to ask what the expectations are in the particular role and what is valued as scholarship (what "counts" towards promotion, etc.).

How do you get one of these jobs? Evidence that you have your own reserach ideas is helpful, even if this takes the form of less traditional products (e.g. blog posts).  

### Opportunities in statistics education research - Beth Chance

There is an important foundation for statistics education research in psychology research and within mathematics education research. However, we still need to consider what is different about teaching statistical reasoning.

Since you are already teaching, think about how can you collect data at the same time. This way you can research your own teaching practice (i.e. classroom-based research).

NSF Improving Undergraduate STEM Education grants support "curricular innovation, experimentation, and implementation" at different levels (from proof of concept to a full scale launch).

### Your first year as faculty - Lucy D'Agostino McGowan

Get to know the norms about both your university as a whole and your department in particular. What meetings are usually attended? What service roles do new professors usually take on? What type of visibility matters?

Aim for harmony (as opposed to elusive "balance") between teaching, research, and service. Block out time in your calendar for each and don't let one bleed into the other. 

Find peers and mentors within and outside your new department and institution to support you in your transition from student to peer.

### Teaching remotely - Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel

There is a tradeoff between the benefit of building community synchronously and the potential unfairnes and inequitability of syncrhonicity.

Be consistent and judicious in your choice of online tools. Just because a tool is free to use doesn't mean it is free to learn. 

Even if your lectures are pre-recorded ahead of time, record a "state of the union" once a week to debrief and respond to feedback in what feels more like real-time.

### Teaching intro statistics - Ulrike Genschel

critical consumers - when can statistics be misleading?

The level you teach at should be the same as the level you assess at.
