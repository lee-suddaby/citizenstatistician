I'm excited to announce that, with support from the National Science Foundation (pending final approval), the Section on Statistics and Data Science Education will host the 2nd annual [Preparing for Careers in Teaching Statistics and Data Science Workshop](https://preparingtoteach.org/) in Fort Collins, Colorado, on July 27 (immediately prior to JSM 2019 in Denver, Colorado). The workshop is designed for graduate students and recent PhDs interested in careers in teaching statistics and data science. 

The purpose of the workshop is to promote interaction, networking, and community building among recent and soon to be PhDs in statistics, data science, and relevant fields who are interested in academic and teaching focused careers and to provide them with valuable insights from leaders in the field. Topics include teaching introductory statistics; teaching data science; teaching-focused career opportunities; opportunities for grants; sharing resources and staying connected. There will be opportunities for interaction and hands-on experience with active learning and computing technologies. The workshop presenters include Beth Chance (Cal Poly), Allan Rossman (Cal Poly), Mine Ã‡etinkaya-Rundel (University of Edinburgh & RStudio), Nicholas Horton (Amherst), and Ulrike Genschel (Iowa State). 

You can find out more about the workshop at [preparingtoteach.org](https://preparingtoteach.org/). You can also browse the materials from the 2018 workshop [here](https://github.com/mine-cetinkaya-rundel/preparing-to-teach).

All participants will receive funding for one night of lodging. A limited number of travel scholarships are available and will be awarded based on demonstrated need. Priority will be given to graduate students finishing their program between Spring 2019 and Fall 2021.

Interested? Please apply at [preparingtoteach.org/apply](https://preparingtoteach.org/apply/) as soon as possible! The deadline for applications is June 21, however we will review applications as they come in and will try to let you know as soon as possible after your submission.
