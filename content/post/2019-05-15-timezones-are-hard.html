<p>Citizen Statistician is back from a hiautus! I hope to post more regularly in
the coming weeks, including writing a post on converting from WordPress to
blogdown.</p>
<p>I have recently been dealing with time zone changes. I‚Äôll say a bit more about
it shortly. But first, here is a picture of my 2.5 year old ‚Äúdealing‚Äù with
time zone change.</p>
<p><img src="/post/2019-05-15-timezones-are-hard_files/toddler-timezone.png" /></p>
<p>His schedule is completely thrown off, he doesn‚Äôt know what to do with himself,
so he keeps moving around in his room in his sleep. This picture also sums up
my feelings about working with date/time data, especially when working across
multiple time zones.</p>
<p>I went down this rabbit hole on a very simple sounding quest: find some weather
data for two cities in the world. I use Darksky on my phone for weather (I
have thoughts about whether it‚Äôs really the ‚Äúmost accurate source of hyperlocal weather information‚Äù<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> but whatever‚Ä¶) so I figured I‚Äôd try the Darksky API.</p>
<p>Whenever I want to do anything in R, I first tell myself ‚Äúthere‚Äôs probably a
package for that‚Äù. And this statement is true ~90% of the time. There is
indeed an R package called darksky<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>,
authored by <a href="https://twitter.com/hrbrmstr">Bob Rudis</a> et al., that
serves as an R interface to the Dark Sky API.</p>
<p>I‚Äôll use three packages for this exploration:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(darksky)
suppressMessages(library(tidyverse))
suppressMessages(library(lubridate))</code></pre>
<p>Let‚Äôs start with getting today‚Äôs hourly data for Durham, NC. I couldn‚Äôt
decide what to use as precise location in Durham without disclosing my home
address, so I went with the latitude and longitude for RDU (Raleigh-Durham International Airport). There‚Äôs probably a package for looking up airport
locations as well, but I just used Google for this information. Note that
you need to indicate West with a minus sign.</p>
<p><img src="/post/2019-05-15-timezones-are-hard_files/rdu-lat-long.png" style="width:70.0%" /></p>
<pre class="r"><code>RDU &lt;- list(lat = 35.8801, lon = -78.7880, time = &quot;2019-05-15T00:00:00-04:00&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>In the same list we also set the date/time to midnight on 15 May 2019. The time
zone is Eastern Daylight Time, which is GMT-4, incidated by the <code>-04:00</code> at the
end of the time text string.</p>
<p>Finally, we fetch the forecast for today at RDU with <code>darksky::get_forecast_for()</code>. I only need the hourly forecast so I‚Äôll exclude
<code>daily</code> and <code>currently</code> results.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>rdu_forecast &lt;- get_forecast_for(RDU$lat, RDU$lon, RDU$time, exclude = &quot;daily,currently&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Let‚Äôs take a look at the result:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>as_tibble(rdu_forecast$hourly)</code></pre>
<pre><code># # A tibble: 24 x 18

# #   cloudCover &lt;dbl&gt;, uvIndex &lt;int&gt;, visibility &lt;dbl&gt;, ozone &lt;dbl&gt;,
# #   precipType &lt;chr&gt;</code></pre>
<p>And this is where I got lost for a bit. Why does the forecast start at
<code>2019-05-15 05:00:00</code> instead of <code>2019-05-15 00:00:00</code>?</p>
<p>I tried a bunch of things, and finally decided to peek at the raw JSON response
from the Darksky API by turning on the <code>add_json</code> argument in the <code>get_forecast_for()</code> function.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>rdu_forecast_json &lt;- get_forecast_for(RDU$lat, RDU$lon, RDU$time, exclude = &quot;daily,currently&quot;, add_json = TRUE)</code></pre>
<p>My default method for browsing JSON files is using the viewer in RStudio, and
then using the selector to help me grab an element in the file.</p>
<p><img src="/post/2019-05-15-timezones-are-hard_files/browsing-json.gif" /></p>
<pre class="r"><code>rdu_forecast_json[[&quot;json&quot;]][[&quot;hourly&quot;]][[&quot;data&quot;]][[1]][[&quot;time&quot;]]</code></pre>
<pre><code># [1] 1557892800</code></pre>
<p>The Darsky API mentions UNIX time (seconds since midnight GMT on 1 Jan 1970), so let‚Äôs convert it.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>rdu_forecast_json[[&quot;json&quot;]][[&quot;hourly&quot;]][[&quot;data&quot;]][[1]][[&quot;time&quot;]] %&gt;%
  as.POSIXct(origin = &quot;1970-01-01&quot;)</code></pre>
<pre><code># [1] &quot;2019-05-15 05:00:00 BST&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Ah, there we go! This is 05:00 British Standard Time, which is the time zone
where I happen to be running this code. If so, the following <em>should</em> give me
what I want:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>rdu_forecast_json[[&quot;json&quot;]][[&quot;hourly&quot;]][[&quot;data&quot;]][[1]][[&quot;time&quot;]] %&gt;%
  as.POSIXct(origin = &quot;1970-01-01&quot;, tz = &quot;America/New_York&quot;)</code></pre>
<pre><code># [1] &quot;2019-05-15 EDT&quot;</code></pre>
<p>I <em>think</em> this is right, but it bugs me that I don‚Äôt see 00:00 there. Let‚Äôs try
another timezone to check.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>rdu_forecast_json[[&quot;json&quot;]][[&quot;hourly&quot;]][[&quot;data&quot;]][[1]][[&quot;time&quot;]] %&gt;%
  as.POSIXct(origin = &quot;1970-01-01&quot;, tz = &quot;America/Los_Angeles&quot;)</code></pre>
<pre><code># [1] &quot;2019-05-14 21:00:00 PDT&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Alright, seeing both 5am BST and 9pm PDT gives me enough to say this is indeed
midnight EDT. So if I want the hour to show up as 00:00 instead of 05:00, I
should subtract 5 from the hour.</p>
<p>What I ultimately wanted to do was to calculate average temperature in 4 time
periods during the day (night, morning, afternoon, evening) and plot them. And
I‚Äôll use the blue from the American flag for the points and lines.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<pre class="r"><code>us_blue &lt;- &quot;#002664&quot;

rdu_forecast$hourly %&gt;% 
  mutate(
    hour = hour(time) - 5, # because package converts to local time
    time_of_day = cut(hour, breaks = 4, labels = c(&quot;night&quot;, &quot;morning&quot;, &quot;afternoon&quot;, &quot;evening&quot;))
    ) %&gt;%
  group_by(time_of_day) %&gt;%
  summarize(mean_temp = mean(apparentTemperature)) %&gt;%
  ggplot(aes(x = time_of_day, y = mean_temp)) +
    geom_line(group = 1, color = us_blue)  + 
    geom_point(color = us_blue) +
    labs(x = &quot;&quot;, y = &quot;Mean temperature (F)&quot;, 
         title = &quot;Apparent temperature&quot;,
         subtitle = &quot;May 15, 2019 - Durham, NC&quot;) +
    scale_y_continuous(limits = c(40, 80),
                       sec.axis = sec_axis(trans = ~(. - 32) * (5/9), 
                                           name = &quot;Mean temperature (C)&quot;))</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2019-05-15-timezones-are-hard_files/figure-html/rdu-plot-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Here I have split the day into four time periods with <code>cut()</code>, calculated mean
temperature for each time period. This information, along with information
on precipitation and humidity, is how I decide what to wear depending on what
hours of the day I‚Äôll be out of the house.</p>
<p>In the visualization I‚Äôve also used dual y-axes üò±, as I
need to retrain my brain to process Celcius information quickly. I believe
this is one of the accepted uses of dual axes though, since the same data is
being plotted on different scales (degrees Fahrenheit vs.¬†Celcius).</p>
<p>Next, let‚Äôs create a similar plot for weather in Edinburgh, Scotland. For parity,
let‚Äôs go with the latitude and longitude of the airport here as well, and use the
blue from the Scottish flag.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<pre class="r"><code># set location and time for EDI

<p><img src="/post/2019-05-15-timezones-are-hard_files/figure-html/edi-plot-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Oh, actually let me make a few more subtle changes to the code to ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù the
spelling of some of the functions and arguments.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># set colour

edi_forecast$hourly %&gt;% 
  mutate(
    hour = hour(time),

         title = &quot;Apparent temperature&quot;,
         subtitle = &quot;15 May 2019 - Edinburgh, UK&quot;) +
    scale_y_continuous(limits = c(40, 80),
                       sec.axis = sec_axis(trans = ~(. - 32) * (5/9), 
                                           name = &quot;Mean temperature (C)&quot;))</code></pre>
<p>And here is a better snapshot of what changed.</p>
<p><img src="/post/2019-05-15-timezones-are-hard_files/us-to-uk.png" /></p>
<p>Weather has been lovely in Edinburgh for the last few days. Apparently it‚Äôs
called ‚Äútaps aff‚Äù weather<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a>,
which Urban Dictionary defines as ‚Äúthe removing of one‚Äôs shirt or other upper
body garments, most often in the event of warm weather‚Äù<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a>).</p>
<p>This was an exercise in figuring out how the Darksky API works so that
I can fetch some local weather data to use in my new course come September.
I‚Äôll be working on developing a lesson module around it <a href="https://github.com/mine-cetinkaya-rundel/darksky">here</a>.</p>
<p>But ultimately ‚Ä¶</p>
<p><i>
I have written<br />
this blog post<br />
just to say<br />
that I have</p>
<p>moved to<br />
Edinburgh.<br />
Timezones<br />
are hard</p>
<p>in data science<br />
and in real life.<br />
So forgive me<br />
if I haven‚Äôt responded to your email last week</p>
<p>I will, soon as my toddler is back on schedule‚Ä¶<br />
</i></p>
<p>(Also forgive me, as poetry has never been my strong suit.)</p>
