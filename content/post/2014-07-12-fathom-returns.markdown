The other shoe has fallen.  Last week (or so) [Tinkerplots](http://citizen-statistician.org/2014/06/30/tinkerplots-available-again/) returned to the market, and now Fathom Version 2.2 (which is the foundation on which Tinkerplots is built) is  available for a free download.  Details are available on [Bill Finzer](http://williamfinzer.com)'s website.

Fathom is one of my favorite softwares...the first commercially available package to be based on learning theory, Fathom's primary goal is to teach statistics.  After a one-minute introduction, beginning students can quickly discuss 'findings' across several variables.  So many classroom exercises involve only one or two variables, and Fathom taught me  that this is unfair to students and artificially holds them back.

Welcome back, Fathom!
