Participating in the "hangout" hosted by Jess Hemerly's Policy By the Numbers blog was fun, but even better was learning about this cool blog.  It's very exciting to meet people from so many different backgrounds and from so many varied interests who share an interest in data accessibility.  One feature  of PBtN that I think many of our readers will find particularly useful is the [weekly roundup of data in the news.](http://policybythenumbers.blogspot.com/2012/11/this-week-in-data-11162012.html) Check it out!
