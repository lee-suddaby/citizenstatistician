[![JSM2016](http://citizen-statistician.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Screen-Shot-2016-07-28-at-23.28.45-300x227.png)](https://www.amstat.org/meetings/jsm/2016/)

JSM 2016 is almost here. I just spent an hour going through the (very) lengthy program. I _think_ that was time well spent, though some might argue I should have been working on my talk instead...

Here is what my itinerary looks like as of today. If you know of a session that you think I might be interested in that I missed, please let me know! And if you go to any one of these sessions and not see me there, it means I got distracted by something else (or something close by).

That's it folks! It's an ambitious itinerary, let's hope I get through it all.

I probably won't get a chance to write daily digests like I've tried to do in previous years at JSM, but I'll tweet about interesting things I hear from [@minebocek](https://twitter.com/minebocek). I'm sure there will be lots of JSM chatter at [#JSM2016](https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&vertical=default&q=%23JSM2016&src=typd) as well.

Now, somebody give me something else to look forward to, and tell me Chicago is cooler than Durham!
