Many moons ago we wrote about a bit of a kludge to get data from a Fitbit ([see here](http://citizen-statistician.org/2012/09/27/fit-bit/)). Now it looks as though there is a much better way. Cory Nissen has written an R package to scrape Fitbit data and [posted it on GitHub](http://blog.corynissen.com/2015/01/r-package-to-download-fitbit-data.html). He also wrote a blog post on his blog [Stats and Things](http://blog.corynissen.com/2015/01/r-package-to-download-fitbit-data.html) announcing the package and demonstrating its use. While I haven't tried it yet, it looks pretty straight-forward and much easier than anything else i have seen to date.
