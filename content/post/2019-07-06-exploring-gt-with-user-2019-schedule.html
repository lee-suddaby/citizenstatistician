<p>I had been meaning to try out the <a href="https://gt.rstudio.com/"><strong>gt</strong></a> package
for a while now, but didn’t really have a great use case for it. However over
the last few days I’ve been looking over the
<a href="http://www.user2019.fr/talk_schedule/">useR 2019 schedule</a> and felt like I
would have an easier time picking which talks I want to go to if the schedule
was formatted in wide format (talks occurring at the same time in different
rooms listed next to each other) as opposed to the long format.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Since “wide” and “long” are not well-defined concepts, let me first clarify what
I mean by them in this context: wide refers to data frames where is row is a
time slot and each column is a session/room and long refers to data frames where
each row is a talk.</p>
<p>I have to admit some of the data processing steps are more manual than I would
have liked, but overall I’m pretty happy with the result! You can view and
interact with the resulting flexdashboard <a href="https://connect.rstudioservices.com/content/331/user2019-schedule.html">here</a>.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>
The entire code associated with this mini-project can be found <a href="https://github.com/mine-cetinkaya-rundel/user2019-schedule">here</a>.</p>

<p>Some highlights are:</p>
<ul>
<li>I feel like I rarely have a use for <code>tibble::add_row()</code>, but this function
came really handy for this task when adding what one might call interim column
headers (session names). Something that makes sense, but I hadn’t really thought
about before, is that when adding multiple rows throughout a data frame the row
index changes as you add rows. My tables were pretty short so I counted the rows
but a more programmatic way to determine the row index might be preferable.</li>
</ul>

<p><br></p>
<ul>
<li><code>tidyr::pivot_*()</code> functions are da bomb! Going from long to wide format
was a breeze with <code>pivot_wider()</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/post/2019-07-06-exploring-gt-with-user-2019-schedule_files/highlight-02.jpeg" /></p>
<p><br></p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>gt</strong> package has super sleek functionality for styling rows/columns/cells,<br />
and fantastic documentation and website. I did much of this work on a plane
without WiFi<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> and the figures
in the R help files were super helpful for figuring out how the functions work.
Every package with some visual aspects to its output should include figures in the
help files.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/post/2019-07-06-exploring-gt-with-user-2019-schedule_files/highlight-03.jpeg" /></p>
<p><br></p>
<ul>
<li><code>gt::fmt_markdown()</code> is pretty handy for styling text inside cells. You can
have a source file that includes markdown formatting in the text, e.g.
a spreadsheet with cells with text <em><code>_italicized_</code></em> and that gets reflected
in the output.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/post/2019-07-06-exploring-gt-with-user-2019-schedule_files/highlight-04.jpeg" /></p>
<p><br></p>
<ul>
<li>Finally, I loved my first foray into gt tables, but I’m not over my love for
<code>DT::datatable()</code> yet. I was going to build a Shiny component for the abstracts
page for searching for keywords, but then I remembered <code>DT::datatable()</code> has
built-in search functionality so I went with that. I much prefer gt tables for
styling as I am not a fan of needing to read the JavaScript help page to figure
out all the options one might need for <code>DT::datatable()</code> but the out of the box
(limited but sufficient) interactivity it offers is hard to beat.</li>
</ul>

<p>I’m happy to answer any questions about this process. Just don’t ask me whether
my conference talk is ready!</p>
<p>Below is a more detailed account of the data scraping, processing, and
communication parts of this mini-project.</p>
<div id="scrape" class="section level2">
<h2>Scrape</h2>
<p>First I checked that I’m indeed allowed to scrape the useR 2019 website using
<code>robotstxt::paths_allowed()</code>:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(robotstxt)
paths_allowed(&quot;http://www.user2019.fr/talk_schedule/&quot;)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## 
 www.user2019.fr</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] TRUE</code></pre>
<p>I used the tidyverse, rvest, glue, and tools packages to scrape and process
the data into a format I wanted.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(tidyverse)
library(rvest)
library(glue)
library(tools)</code></pre>
<p>Data scraping took only two functions, <code>read_html()</code> and <code>html_table()</code>:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># read schedule page -----------------------------------------------------------
page &lt;- read_html(&quot;http://www.user2019.fr/talk_schedule/&quot;)

# extract table ----------------------------------------------------------------
tabs &lt;- page %&gt;%
  html_table(&quot;td&quot;, header = TRUE)</code></pre>
<p>This results in a list with three elements, one for each day of the conference<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a>: Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.</p>
</div>
<div id="process" class="section level2">
<h2>Process</h2>
<p>Since the format of the tables for each day is essentially the same, I wrote a
function to process each one and write out two CSV files per day: one in wide
format for the talks and the other in long format for the abstracts.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># function to process data -----------------------------------------------------
process_schedule &lt;- function(day_tab, day_name){
  
  # remove unused columns ----
  raw &lt;- day_tab %&gt;% select(-2, -Slides)
  
  # create talks_long ----
  talks_long &lt;- raw %&gt;%
    slice(seq(1, nrow(raw), by = 2)) %&gt;%
    mutate(info = as.character(glue(&quot;{Title} &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; _{Speaker}_&quot;)))
  
  # create talks_wide ----
  talks_wide &lt;- talks_long %&gt;%
    select(Time, Room, info) %&gt;%
    pivot_wider(names_from = Room, values_from = info) %&gt;%
    select(Time, `Concorde 1+2`, `Cassiopée`, `Caravelle 2`, 
           `Saint-Exupéry`, `Ariane 1+2`, `Guillaumet 1+2`)
  
  # create abstracts_long ----
  abstracts_long &lt;- raw %&gt;%
    slice(seq(2, nrow(raw), by = 2)) %&gt;%
    rename(Abstract = Time) %&gt;%
    select(Abstract) %&gt;%
    bind_cols(talks_long, .) %&gt;%
    mutate(Day = toTitleCase(day_name)) %&gt;%
    select(Day, Time, Title, Speaker, Abstract, Session, Room, Chair)
  
  # write out ----
  write_csv(talks_wide, glue(&quot;data/{day_name}_talks_wide.csv&quot;))
  write_csv(abstracts_long, glue(&quot;data/{day_name}_abstracts_long.csv&quot;))
  
}</code></pre>
<p>Two comments about this function:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the scraped data talks appear in the odd numbered rows and the abstracts
appear in the even numbered rows. Hence I used <code>slice(seq(1, nrow(raw), by = 2))</code>
or <code>slice(seq(2, nrow(raw), by = 2))</code> to grab these rows.</li>
<li>You need to have a <code>data/</code> folder in your working directory for this function
to work.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then I ran the function once per each day. I could have done a map or apply
step here, but writing this out three times didn’t seem too cumbersome:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># process days -----------------------------------------------------------------
process_schedule(tabs[[1]], &quot;wed&quot;)
process_schedule(tabs[[2]], &quot;thu&quot;)
process_schedule(tabs[[3]], &quot;fri&quot;)</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="communicate" class="section level2">
<h2>Communicate</h2>
<p>Finally I used a flexdashboard to put everything together. The code for the
flexdashboard can be found <a href="https://github.com/mine-cetinkaya-rundel/user2019-schedule/blob/master/user2019-schedule.Rmd">here</a>.</p>
<p>Couple styling notes on the dashboard: I used the yeti theme with a custom color
navbar (a lighter tint of the blue used for highlighting certain rows).</p>
