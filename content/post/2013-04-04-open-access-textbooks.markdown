In an effort to reduce costs for students, the [College of Education and Human Development](http://www.cehd.umn.edu) at the [University of Minnesota](http://www.umn.edu) has created this [catalog of open textbooks](https://open.umn.edu). Open textbooks are complete textbooks released under a [Creative Commons](http://creativecommons.org), or similar, license. Instructors can customize open textbooks to fit their course needs by remixing, editing, and adding their own content. Students can access free digital versions or purchase low-cost print copies of open textbooks.

The searchable catalog, which includes a few statistics books, can be accessed at [https://open.umn.edu](https://open.umn.edu).
