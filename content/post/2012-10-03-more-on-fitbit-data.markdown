First the good news:



[![Your data belongs to you!](http://citizen-statistician.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Fitbit-Data-Raw-Export-300x128.jpg)](http://citizen-statistician.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Fitbit-Data-Raw-Export.jpg)

And now the bad: It costs you $50/ year for your data to truly belong to you.  For a 'premium' membership, you can visit your data as often as you choose.  If only Andy had posted sooner, I would have saved $50.  But, dear readers, in order to explore all avenues, I spent the bucks.  And here's some data (screenshot--I don't want you analyzing *my* data!)

It's pretty easy and painless.  Next I'll try Andy's advice, and see if I can save $50 next year.
