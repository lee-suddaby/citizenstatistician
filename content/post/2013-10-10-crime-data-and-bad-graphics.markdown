I'm working on the 2nd edition of our textbook, Gould & Ryan, and was looking for some examples of bad statistical graphics.  Last time, I used FBI data and created a good and bad graphic from the data. This time, I was pleased to see that the FBI provided its own bad graphic.[![fbi crime bad graph](http://citizen-statistician.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/fbi-crime-bad-graph-300x264.jpeg)](http://citizen-statistician.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/fbi-crime-bad-graph.jpeg)

This shows a dramatic decrease in crime over the last 5 years.  (Not sure why 2012 data aren't yet available.) Of course, this graph is only a bad graph if the purpose is to show the rate of decrease.  If you look at it simply as a table of numbers, it is not so bad.

Here's the graph on the appropriate scale.

Still, a decrease worth bragging about.  But, alas, somewhat less dramatic.
